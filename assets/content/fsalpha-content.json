[FS Alpha Fixed Parameter Scenario](https://fsalpha.fireflysemantics.com/start) asks:\n\n> What is the optimal stocking level for the set of parameters:\n\n- `Purchase Cost`: **$20,000**\n- `Sales Price`: **$40,000**\n- `Lead Time Days`: **700**\n- `Cost of Capital`: **12%**\n- `Expected Annual Demand`: **5 Units**\n\n[Try out the fixed parameter demo by clicking this application link](https://fsalpha.fireflysemantics.com/welcome).\n\nKnowing the [Optimal Stocking Level](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--optimization--optimal-stocking-level) is nice, but seeing how we arrived at the answer is much better.\n\nThis gives us insight into the value that the evaluated stocking levels provide.\n\nThis is particularly important since [marginal value](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--profit--marginal-value) decreases as the stocking level increases.\n\n[FS Alpha](https://fsalpha.fireflysemantics.com/welcome) provides the calculations associated with each step of the optimization process such that values associated with all the metrics calculated can be evaluated by planners.\n\n## Guide by Example\n\nSince abstract theory can get rather dry, we will look at one iteration of the optimization process.\n\nSpecifically we will look at moving from a stocking level of 10 units to a stocking level of 11 units and explain the calculations of the metrics:\n\n- [Number of Fills](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--inventory--number-of-fills)\n- [Marginal Number of Fills](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--inventory--marginal-number-of-fills)\n- [Profit](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--profit--profit)\n- [Marginal Profit](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--profit--marginal-profit)\n- [Inventory Cost](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--inventory--inventory-cost)\n- [Marginal Inventory Cost](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--inventory--marginal-inventory-cost)\n- [Net Profit](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--profit--net-profit)\n- [Marginal Net Profit](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--profit--marginal-net-profit)\n\nWhen [Marginal Net Profit](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--profit--marginal-net-profit) turns negative, the [optimal stocking level](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--optimization--optimal-stocking-level) has been found.\n\nNote that when comparing the result here, to the result in the app, the numbers may be slightly different due to more aggressive rounding here.\n\n\n## Approach\n\nIn order to answer the optimal stocking level question we have to be able to do 2 things:\n\n- Calculate the [Marginal Inventory Cost](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--inventory--marginal-inventory-cost) of increasing the stocking level by 1 unit\n- Calculate the [Marginal Profit](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--profit--marginal-profit) associated with the increase to the stocking level of 1 unit\n\nSo in other words, if we increase the stocking level by one unit, how much of an increase in profit do we expect to see?\n\nAlso, how much of an increase in inventory cost do we incur correspondingly by stocking one additional unit?\n\nOnce we have a model that allows us to calculate these things we can:\n\n- Increase the stocking level by one unit\n- Compare [Marginal Inventory Cost](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--inventory--marginal-inventory-cost) to [Marginal Profit](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--profit--marginal-profit)\n\n\nIncrease stocking level by one unit again until [Marginal Inventory Cost](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--inventory--marginal-inventory-cost) exceeds [Marginal Profit](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--profit--marginal-profit).\n\nAt this point Marginal Net Profit is negative.\n\n## Assumption\n\nThe assumption is that we will be employing an [S, S-1 Inventory Policy](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--inventory--average-inventory-level). \n\nThis is the type of inventory policy that is commonly used with long lead time, capital intensive, low demand service parts.\n\n## Step 1: Calculating Lead Time Demand\n\nThe first thing FS Alpha needs to know is what the lead time demand for the part is.\n\nOur expected `annual average demand` is `5` units, therefore the `expected average lead time demand` is `5* 365 / 700`, or `9.58`.\n\nThis is the `average demand level` we expect to see during the `lead time` for the part.\n\nIf we were to repeat each `lead time` period as an experiment `1000` times, we would see real demand values that fluctuate around this average, like 5, 11,15, 7, 3, and so on, and if we averaged out these numbers the value would be approximately `9.58`.\n\n\n## Step 2: Creating the Demand Probability Distribution\n\nIn order to model the increase in the [Number of Fills](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/) that we get from stocking one additional unit we need to create a Demand Probability Distribution around our mean demand level of 9.58.\n\nFirefly Semantics created it’s own distribution based on our research of models used in US Air Force applications.\nLets have a look at a section of the distribution with a mean demand of `9.58`.\n\n```\nDemand Probability\n1       0.000\n2       0.001\n3       0.010\n4       0.029\n5       0.053\n6       0.074\n7       0.090\n8       0.098\n9       0.099\n10      0.094\n11      0.085\n12      0.074\n13      0.062\n14      0.051\n15      0.041\n16      0.032\n17      0.025\n```\n\n## Step 3: Calculating the Number of Fills\n\nTo get the [Expected Number of Fills](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--inventory--number-of-fills) we sum the probabilities up to the stocking level we are considering and multiple that by the mean demand level.\n\n```\nDemand Probability\n1       0.000\n2       0.001\n3       0.010\n4       0.029\n5       0.053\n6       0.074\n7       0.090\n8       0.098\n9       0.099\n10      0.094\n11      0.085\n```\n\nSo the Expected [Number of Fills](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--inventory--number-of-fills) for a stocking level of `10` would be the sum of these values up to **[Demand 10 or the 0.94 value]** times `9.58`:\n\n`.001 + 0.010 + 0.029 + 0.053 + 0.074 + 0.090 + 0.098 + 0.099 + 0.094) * 9.58 or\n0.548* 9.58` \n\nor\n\n`5.25` Units Fulfilled.\n\nSo the [Expected Number of Fills](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--inventory--number-of-fills) for a stocking level of `11` would be the sum of these values up to **[Demand 11 or the 0.85 value]** times `9.58`:\n\n`.001 + 0.010 + 0.029 + 0.053 + 0.074 + 0.090 + 0.098 + 0.099 + 0.094 + 0.085) * 9.58 or\n0.633* 9.58` \n\nor\n\n`6.06` Units Fulfilled.\n\nThe [Marginal Fills](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--inventory--marginal-number-of-fills) going from a stocking level of `10` to `11` is `6.06-5.25` or `0.81` units.\n\nWe have calculated the Units Fulfilled and the Marginal Units Fulfilled. \nWith that we can calculate:\n\n- [Profit](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--profit--profit)\n- [Marginal Profit](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--profit--marginal-profit)\n\n## Step 4: Calculating Profit\n\nThe profit (That we expect to see over the cycle time period ) corresponding to a stocking level of `10` units is:\n\n`5.25 * 20,000 = $105,000`\n\nThe profit corresponding to 11 units is:\n\n`6.06 * 20,000 = $121,200`\n\nThe marginal profit is:\n`6.06-5.25 * 20,000 = 0.81 * 20,000 = $16,200`\n\nSo the marginal profit we gain from moving from `10` units to `11` units is `0.81 * 20,000 = 16,200`.\n\n\n## Step 5: Calculating Average Inventory Levels\n\nThe average inventory level for an [S, S-1 inventory policy](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/formulas--inventory--average-inventory-level) formula can also be found by clicking here. We’ve included the entire thing below for easy reference.\n\nAccording to the formula if the initial stocking level is `10` then we get:\n\n`(10–9.58) + 0.5 = 0.92`\n\nIf the initial stocking level is `11` then we get:\n\n `(11–9.58) + 0.5 = 1.92`\n\n## Step 6: Calculating Inventory Cost\n\nIf our [average inventory level](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/formulas--inventory--average-inventory-level) is `0.92` units and our `cost of capital` is `12%` then the inventory cost over the lead time period is:\n\n`0.92 * 700/365 * 0.12 * 20,000`\n\nOr \n\n`$4234.52`\n\n\nIf our [average inventory level](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/formulas--inventory--average-inventory-level) is `1.92` units and our `cost of capital` is `12%` then the inventory cost over the lead time period is:\n\n`1.92 * 700/365 * 0.12 * 20,000`\n\nOr \n\n`$8837.26`\n\nThe [Marginal Inventory Cost](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--inventory--marginal-inventory-cost) incurred in moving from 10 to 11 units is `$8837.26-$4234.52`\n\nor\n\n`$4,602.74`\n\n\n\n\n## Step 7: Comparing Marginal Profit to Marginal Inventory Cost\n\nOur [Marginal Profit](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--profit--marginal-profit) was `$16,200`. The [Marginal Inventory Cost](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--inventory--marginal-inventory-cost) is `$4,602.74` . The [Net Profit](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--profit--net-profit) is:\n\n`$16,200 - $4,602.74 = $11,597.26`\n\nThus our [Net Profit](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--profit--net-profit) is still positive and will continue to be so until we examine stocking `17` units. \n\nAt that point the [Marginal Profit](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--profit--marginal-profit) is so small that [Net Profit](https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--profit--net-profit) turns negative.\nThus our Optimal Stocking Level is `16` units.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis took us through one step in the evaluation of the FS Alpha Optimization Algorithm.\n\nWe can see that FS Alpha helps us evaluate profitability in the scenario that includes demand level as a starting point.\n\nFS Beta, which will be released soon, considers all possible demand levels and scores them by the probability of that demand scenario occurring.","html":"<p>The <a

here, to the result in the app, the numbers may be slightly different due to more aggressive rounding here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n<p>In order to answer the optimal stocking level question we have to be able to do 2 things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Calculate the <a href=\"https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--inventory--marginal-inventory-cost\">Marginal Inventory Cost</a> of increasing the stocking level by 1 unit</li>\n<li>Calculate the <a href=\"https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--profit--marginal-profit\">Marginal Profit</a> associated with the increase to the stocking level of 1 unit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So in other words, if we increase the stocking level by one unit, how much of an increase in profit do we expect to see?</p>\n<p>Also, how much of an increase in inventory cost do we incur correspondingly by stocking one additional unit?</p>\n<p>Once we have a model that allows us to calculate these things we can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase the stocking level by one unit</li>\n<li>Compare <a href=\"https://help-service-parts.fireflysemantics.com/topic/concepts--inventory--marginal-inventory-cost\">Marginal

<code>average demand level</code> we expect to see during the <code>lead time</code> for the part.</p>\n<p>If we were to repeat each <code>lead time</code> period as an experiment <code>1000</code> times, we would see real demand values that fluctuate around this average, like 5, 11,15, 7, 3, and so on, and if we averaged out these numbers the value would be approximately
